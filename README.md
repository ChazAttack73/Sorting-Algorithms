# Sorting Algorithms

This collection of sorting algorithms includes the following:
  * Bubble Sort
  * Quick Sort
  * Merge Sort
  * Insertion Sort
  * Selection Sort

###Bubble Sort:
  Takes an array of numbers and arranges them in order from smallest to largest, left to right. Starts from arr[0] (furthest on the left) and compares to the next postition immediately to the right. If smaller in value the number stays in place, if larger in value the number swaps positions in the array. This continues through the length of the array until all numbers have been swapped into the properly ordered positions.

  ####Worst case performance: O(n^2), Best case performance: O(n).
